#Pokemon Creator

Pokemon Creator is an app that lets you create, save and share pokemon teams. 
The app/page is created with React for the client side and Node Express for server side. Instead of using a database data i saved to a JSON file.

Its built around two API's to function as intended. The local API created with node Express allows you to get, update, create and delete teams that contains of an id, name and an array of pokemons. The second API thats being used to make this app functioning is "pokeapi" which is being used to get details about the 150 first pokemon. 

To run the project you need to install both the client and the server. Do this by navigating in the terminal to respective path, cd server / cd client and then run "npm install" on both. When installation is done run npm start on both paths and the server should be upp and running.
